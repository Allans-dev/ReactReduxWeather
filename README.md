Earth at noon

The app let's the user search for a location anywhere in the world and return a five day forecast of the weather at noon each day.
On selecting the display a component will replace the other search results displaying detailed weather information.

In the current wireframe it will have a temperature graph showing the temperature range for the next five days, as well as average. And other information available from openweather API.
Also looking to get descriptive data from climate apis (if any found) or/and wikipedia for location images and brief location
description.
Possible link to ocean data for surf forecasts in a link (to demonstrate single page app use and react router).
Integration with google maps to display location and possible tinkering with closest beach feature (unlikely but hopeful).
